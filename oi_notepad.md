<h2>Syncing notes with a Horde server</h2>

When used together with a <a href='Horde.md'>Horde</a> groupware server: There can be several notebooks. If there is more than just one notebook, then <i>ChBoSync</i> seems to sync only the <i>first</i> notebook, whereas <i>"first"</i> means the first notebook according to the alphabetical order (i.e. the notebook that is the upper-most one in the list of notebooks on the left side of the WebUI).<br>
<br><br>

<h2>Encrypted notes</h2>

<i>OI Notepad</i> can encrypt individual notes if the companion app  <i><a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.openintents.safe'>OI Safe</a></i> is also installed on the device. Please see the notes concerning encrypted notes <i><a href='Limitations.md'>on the page with known limitations</a></i>.
