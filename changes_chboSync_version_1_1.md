# Changelog: Changes for version 1.1 of _ChBoSync_ #

  * Self-signed certificates from the server are accepted (this feature from the _[PTBV\_SyncML\_Client](PTBV_SyncML_Client.md)_ was not available in Version 1.1 of _ChBoSync_ due to a error during packaging of the external libs). Added warning on the login screen saying that such certificates are accepted by the app.

  * Improved translatable strings.

  * Added link to new sourcecode repository at _GitHub_ on about screen because of the _[upcoming shutdown of "Google Code"](http://google-opensource.blogspot.de/2015/03/farewell-to-google-code.html)_.
