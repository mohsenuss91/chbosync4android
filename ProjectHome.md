_ChBoSync_ is a free _[SyncML](SyncML.md) client_ for Android based on _[Funambol](Funambol.md)_'s open source suite & the _[PTBV SyncML Client](PTBV_SyncML_Client.md)_. The app can sync calendar entries, contacts & notes.

License: GNU Affero General Public License version 3 ([AGPL](AGPL.md)).

_ChBoSync_ was developed for synchronization with data on a _[Horde](Horde.md) server_, which is a groupware solution that supports SyncML. _ChBoSync_ should also work with other groupware solutions that support SyncML, but the only other server we tested was Funambol's own server.
